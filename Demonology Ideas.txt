	Basic Idea: Power at a cost; demon magic isn't all fun and games, there's a give and take to such forbidden doings.
		-Make contracts with demons for powers, but at a cost.
		-Can overtake demons and reclaim your contract.
		-Advancing to next tier has a cost; you must decide if you wish to further your conections to the Demon World.
		-Souls are your bread-and-butter. Need souls to cast magic; later on, souls are also your sustinance.



Ideas:
	Story-
	Questline-

	Biomes and Blocks(?)-
		+Seven Levels of Hell
	Becoming a Demon-
		+Tiers of Demonhood; with every step up, some humanity is lost, at the higher tiers all humanity is lost.
			-All humanity is lost upon becoming a True Demon.
		+True Demon is when all humanity is lost and one becomes a full demon.
			-True Demons have a True Demon Form, which gives them certain buffs depending on which type is chosen.
			-Once a True Demon, uses True Demon model and must disguise to look like a human.
			-Types of True Demon are:
				LOOK IN TRUE DEMON TYPE TAB
		+Souls required for spells and later sustinance.
			-Souls aquired by contracts with NPCs.
				+Only a small percent chance a villager is willing to make a contract.
			-Demon souls can be aquired by killing demons or making contracts with lesser demons; worth more than reqular Soul.
			-Can make contracts with stronger demons for a payment of Souls.
		+As you progress, your human body mutates, showing your connection to the Demon World.
			-You can disguise as a regular human, at a rate of Soul power.
			-As you become more mutated, villagers will stop trading with you and eventually flee from you.
			-Once you become a True Demon, then one no longer appears mutated.
