	Basic Idea: Power at a cost; demon magic isn't all fun and games, there's a give and take to such forbidden doings.
		-Make contracts with demons for powers, but at a cost.
		-Can overtake demons and reclaim your contract.
		-Advancing to next tier has a cost; you must decide if you wish to further your conections to the Demon World.
		-Souls are your bread-and-butter. Need souls to cast magic; later on, souls are also your sustinance.



Ideas:
	Story-
	Questline-
		+To start your journey in Demonology, must create a Demonology Grimoire, then summon one of the weakest demons and make a contract. 
	Demons-
		+Can make contracts with demons for spells, but at a cost.
		+Can overthrow demons that have contracts with you to reclaim your contracts.
		+Spells given by demons may have reprocussions, but can be permanently learned with no reprocussions if you overthrow the demon.
	Spells and Weapons-
		+Spells cost Soul power.
		+Spells obtained from Demons may reprocussions for use in certain situations.
		+Spells are saved in you Demonology Grimoire.
		+Hot key to open Magic Inventory and Spell Hot Bar.
			-Magic Inventory holds all one's spells.
			-Can drag spells into 9 hotbar slots for Hot Bar Spells.
			-When using Spell Hot Bar, one has an empty hand.
		+Hot key to open toggleable abilities to make activating certain ablilities quicker and easier.
	Biomes and Blocks(?)-
		+Seven Levels of Hell
	Becoming a Demon-
		+Tiers of Demonhood; with every step up, some humanity is lost, at the higher tiers all humanity is lost.
			-All humanity is lost upon becoming a True Demon.
		+True Demon is when all humanity is lost and one becomes a full demon.
			-True Demons have a True Demon Form, which gives them certain buffs depending on which type is chosen.
			-Once a True Demon, uses True Demon model and must disguise to look like a human.
			-Types of True Demon are:
				LOOK IN TRUE DEMON TYPE TAB
		+True Demon at level 5.
		+Souls required for spells and later sustinance.
			-Souls aquired by contracts with NPCs.
				+Only a small percent chance a villager is willing to make a contract.
			-Demon souls can be aquired by killing demons or making contracts with lesser demons; worth more than reqular Soul.
			-Can make contracts with stronger demons for a payment of Souls.
		+As you progress, your human body mutates, showing your connection to the Demon World.
			-You can disguise as a regular human, at a rate of Soul power.
			-As you become more mutated, villagers will stop trading with you and eventually flee from you.
			-Once you become a True Demon, then one no longer appears mutated.
